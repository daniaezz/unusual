Project Name: Stories of the Unusual

Project Description: We tried to make an old school radio show that is a blend of horror and a satire-comedy genres. We wanted the story to take place at NYUAD. For the ending, we wanted to keep an air of mystery for the effect of leaving the audience guessing. For the visual aspect of the website, we wanted to create a vintage portable radio player experience with some interactivity. 

Process: We came up with the rough idea of the story first. It was an idea that stood out from a few different possibilities. On the day of the recording, we finished the full dialogue as a team and went to the Recording Room of the Arts Center. We used the Portable H6 recorder and the Rode Shotgun microphone for the recording.

For the editing, we used the Audacity software. A few of the sound effects were recorded by ourselves (I.e arabic operator sound), but most of the sound effects were collected from FreeSound.org

For the website, our team member Dania used Illustrator to design the visuals. She also worked on the coding and added different interactive elements (Cat eyes. Lights turning off, Button press).

Reflection/Evaluation: We are quite satisfied with the end results. All of our initial expectations were met, recording/editing process was pretty smooth, and we also managed to implement extra interactivity elements on the website. The final recording came together well with the vintage radio show aesthetics of our website. All team members did a great job on their respective tasks and collaborated effectively.
